This readme is about compiling the driver & examples.
See /ether_ipApp/doc for info on how to use the driver.

* Intro
The sources for this driver are CVS-controlled:
CVS root: ics-srv01.sns.ornl.gov:/sns/ADE/cvsroot
Module:   support/linac/ether_ip (aliased as module ether_ip)
Tag:      ether_ip-<RELEASE>

Replace <RELEASE> by the desired release.
You can also just use "current" for the RELEASE
and with a periodic cvs update you'll always have
the most recent one, thought maybe not a good idea
for production where you prefer to have a fixed
version and only upgrade during service times.

Example for getting a specific release:
cvs -d :ext:kasemir@ics-srv01.sns.ornl.gov:/sns/ADE/cvsroot \
     export -r ether_ip-1-11 -d 1-11 ether_ip

What you have to do is
- compile the ether_ip driver/device sources
- somehow load them in the IOC
- include the DBD descriptions of the new device support
  so that EPICS knows about them
- create EPICS records that use the new driver

The directory structure and Makefiles were created by 
makeBaseApp.pl from EPICS R3.13.3 base.  The configure directory
was added and the Makefiles changed to work with EPICS 3.14.1 base.
In case you choose to skip reading the manual on makeBaseApp:
- If you set the EPICS_HOST_ARCH environment variable, the build
  will be done using 3.14 configure files.  
- Choose (or override the base config) for the target architecture
  in config/CONFIG (3.13) or configure/CONFIG (3.14).
- In iocBoot/iocether_ip/Makefile, select the ARCH for the test IOC
  (if you want to use that test setup).
- You have to modify config/RELEASE (3.13) configure/RELEASE (3.14) 
  so that ETHER_IP point to where you put the stuff, e.g.
    ETHER_IP=/cs/epics/ADE/R3.13.3/support/ether_ip/current

* I. ether_ip directory structure:
ether_ip/
    README -- this file
    ether_ipApp/   - the DRIVER/DEVICE. You need this!
        src -- contains the source code and dbd definitions.
               Used to build and install the library
                  ether_ipLib -- containing driver object file
               and to install  
                  ether_ip.dbd -- the database definition file
                                  needed by databases using the driver.
        doc -- contains the driver specific documentation
    testether_ipApp/  - example of EPICS database for ether_ip.
                        You can use this for reference and tests.
        src  -- contains an example application that builds a
                epics module that uses the ether_ip driver.
        Db   -- contains sample databases using the ether_ip driver.
        dm2k -- contains sample dm2k adl display files.

    config -- 3.13 only - configuration setup with RELEASE referring to 
              location of ETHER_IP for use by the example in testether_ipApp

    configure -- 3.14 only - configuration setup with RELEASE referring to 
              location of ETHER_IP for use by the example in testether_ipApp

    Makefile -- setup to build 1st ether_ipApp, 
                then config, 
                then testether_ipApp, so that the
                examples will work.

* II. Build and Test Setup
1. When using some ADE, you might have a setup script
   to get shortcut variables for the various
   locations.  
   In the following example, SUP is set to
       /cs/epics/ADE/R3.13.3/support
2. cd $SUP/ether_ip
3. cvs export -r ether_ip-<RELEASE> -d <RELEASE> ether_ip
4. cd <RELEASE>
4.1.  unsetenv EPICS_HOST_ARCH              (for EPICS 3.13)
4.2.  setenv   EPICS_HOST_ARCH <your_arch>  (for EPICS 3.14)
5. gmake (or gnumake, make, ...)
6. Changing the type of ioc: 
   This code was tested with pc486, mvme2700 and mvme2100 iocs.
   We think it should work for other types of iocs, but we don't
   have others, so we haven't tried that yet.

   Modify iocBoot/iocether_ip for your IOC:
6.1.  cd   iocBoot/iocether_ip and
6.2.  edit the Makefile.
        Set e.g. ARCH = ppc603
6.3.  create a new version of the cdCommands file by typing:
        make clean
        make
6.4.  If you want to watch the test load  on your ioc,
      set the startup "startup script" boot parameter on your ioc to
       /cs/epics/ADE/R3.13.3/support/ether_ip/<RELEASE> \
       /iocBoot/iocether_ip/st.boot 

       st.boot is a small file with just two lines:
            cd  "/cs/epics/ADE/R3.13.3/support/ether_ip/<RELEASE> \
                 /iocBoot/iocether_ip"
            #< st.cmd
       We use this configuration of our iocs so that we can
       watch the booting of an ioc from a telnet session when
       we do not have a serial interface available.
7. Boot your ioc and run some of the displays in
   testether_ipApp/dm2k if you have dm2k available.

* III. Use of the ether_ip driver in your ioc application
1. Make sure that the driver code has been checked out and built
   as described above.  The Make in the config directory
   depends on the proper directories already existing.

2. Set up ETHER_IP definitions  in the configuration directory
   for your application by: 
2.1. cd  <your ioc application>/config (3.13) or /configure (3.14)
2.2. edit the file RELEASE file, add the line 
     ETHER_IP=/cs/epics/ADE/R3.13.3/support/ether_ip/<RELEASE>
2.3. Make sure the new definitions take effect by
           gmake clean
           gmake
     in the config (3.13) or configure (3.14) directory.
3. Set up the  dbd include file in your src directory to include
   ether_ip.dbd by adding the line
             include "ether_ip.dbd"
   after the line include "../base.dbd".
   There is an example in testether_ipApp/src/ether_ipInclude.dbd (3.13)
   or /ether_ip_testInclude.dbd (3.14).

   Now that RELEASE file has been edited and config or configure has been
   rebuilt the Makefile will be able to find ether_ip.dbd
   when it expands your dbd file.
4. Set up your application to include the object libraries by
   including the following line in Makefile.Vx (3.13):
                   LIBOBJS += $(ETHER_IP_BIN)/ether_ipLib
   or the following lines in Makefile (3.14):
                   <app>_LIBS += ether_ip
		   ether_ip_DIR = $(ETHER_IP_LIB)

   ETHER_IP_BIN (3.13) or ETHER_IP_LIB (3.14) will be automatically 
   defined for every type of ioc for which your application is built.
