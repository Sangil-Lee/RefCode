package KSTARBootScan;

# The purpose of this package is to implement subroutines which
# identify ioc's to be crawled, and their startup command file 
# names and paths. Since this differs from EPICS facility to 
# facility, we need to have one of these packages per facility.
#
# Implements the required "find_boot_iocs" subroutine of the BootScan
# package for the SNS facility. This subroutine must return an
# array of hashes, each hash as follows:
#  $boot_info = {ioc_nm=>"$ioc_nm",            # ioc name
#                booted=>"$ioc_booted",        # is it considered booted?
#                boot_date=>"$boot_date",      # date of boot
#                st_cmd_dir=>"$stCmdDir",      # startup command path info
#                st_cmd_file=>"$stCmdFile"};
